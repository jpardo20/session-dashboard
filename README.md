# Session Dashboard

This repository provides a **read-only dashboard** for visualizing
collaborative work sessions based on **precomputed analysis results**.

## Purpose

The dashboard displays:
- roles declared by participants per session
- evidence detected in the repository (commits, files, branches, issues)
- textual coherence descriptions produced by external tools

## Explicit non-goals

This dashboard:
- does NOT analyze Git repositories
- does NOT validate roles
- does NOT infer identities
- does NOT assign grades or scores
- does NOT perform pedagogical evaluation

All analysis is performed **offline** by dedicated tools
(e.g. `session-role-validator`).

The dashboard is a **pure visualization layer**.

## Scope

This project is:
- project-agnostic
- reusable across different collaborative contexts
- independent from any specific educational project (e.g. ASTI)

## Data source

The dashboard consumes structured outputs (JSON / Markdown)
generated by external analysis tools.

It does not access student repositories directly.
